# Cosmos IBC Integration

## IBC Overview

In addition to our own [lite client protocol](./lite-client-protocol), we also allow interaction with our data oracle through Cosmos' [Inter-Blockchain-Communication](https://ibcprotocol.org/), or IBC, protocol. This protocol allows other IBC-compatible blockchains to request data from BandChain.

_This section presented an overview of how IBC can be used to make an oracle data request on BandChain. For more information on IBC itself, its architecture, and other related topics, please see Cosmos' Interchain Standards [documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/ics)._

## BandChain-Specific IBC Data Packet

### OracleRequestPacketData

`OracleRequestPacketData` is a data packet sent by a blockchain to BandChain's oracle to request data. It contains the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ClientID       | string    | The unique identifier of this oracle request, as specified by the client. This same unique ID will be sent back to the requester with the oracle response |
| OracleScriptID | int64     | The unique identifier number assigned to the oracle script when it was first registered on Bandchain                                                      |
| Calldata       | string    | The data that was passed over to the oracle script to use during its execution eg. list of requested symbols and multiplier                               |
| AskCount       | uint64    | The number of validators that are requested to respond to this request                                                                                    |

### OracleResponsePacketData

Subsequently, this is the packet that will be relayed from BandChain back to the requester's chain. It contains information on the response parameters as well as the requested data itself.

| Parameter     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                           |

| AnsCount      | uint64 | The number of validators that answers the request, retrieved the data, and submitted a report                                                                         |
| RequestTime   | int64  | The timestamp of when the request was made                                                                                                                            |

## Requesting Data Through IBC

To make a request to BandChain's oracle using IBC, the module on another IBC-compatible blockchain must first initialize a communication tunnel with the oracle module on BandChain. Once the connection has been established, a pair of channel identifiers is generated -- one for the counterparty chain and one for BandChain.

The channel identifier is an important piece for the counterparty IBC module to route outgoing oracle request packets to the targeted oracle module on BandChain.

Similarly, BandChain's oracle module uses the channel identifier when sending back the oracle response. This means these channel identifiers have to be unique within each module, and the right channel identifier needs to be specified when making an oracle request from the counterparty chain.

![IBC Workflow](https://i.imgur.com/dLArI2g.jpg)

Once a relayer has been set up, the module on another IBC-compatible blockchain looking to make the request must generate an [`OracleRequestPacketData`](#oraclerequestpacketdata) data packet to be relayed. Using their chain's IBC module, they must then relay the message through to BandChain's own IBC module, which will proceed to further send it to the chain's `oracle` module. Once the request packet is successfully received, the subsequent flow is the almost the same as how BandChain handles a native [`MsgRequestData`](./protocol-messages.html#msgrequestdata) message type with a few additional steps. To summarize, the data request flow consists of the following steps:

- First, requesters create a request from their chain which are then relayed to BandChain.
- Once the request is submitted to BandChain, the oracle module fetches the corresponding oracle script and starts the oracle script's preparation phase returning information of all related data sources.
- Then BandChain performs various checks such as preparation phase smaller than the provided prepare gas (This is actually done in the oracle's script preparation phase) and the total fee for the request does not exceed the provided fee limit (More details can be found in the next [section](./on-chain-payment-protocol)).
- (IBC Process Only) Then an acknowledgement is sent back to the requester's chain which either contains the error from the checks or the request identifier created by BandChain.
- If there is no error, the request is then broadcast. Each validator selected for the particular request will then proceeed to retrieve data from each of the data source
- If a validator's retrieval is successful, they will submit back a report to BandChain containing the result they received from each of the data source.
- If the number of validators that managed to successfully submit the report exceeds the `minCount` specified in the `OracleRequestPacketData`, BandChain then computes and stores an aggregate final value.
- (IBC Process Only) The final result is also directly relayed back to the requesting chain and module in the form of a [`OracleResponsePacketData`](#oracleresponsepacketdata) data packet.

As a slight aside, a data request to BandChain generally takes roughly 5 seconds from submitting the initial request until the requester received back the requested result. This is because BandChain's blocktime is set at approximately 3 seconds

## Starport Integration

> NOTE: Work in progress

[Starport](https://cosmos.network/starport/) has offerred an easy way to scaffold a project with an ability to request oracle data from BandChain. Developers can initialize a new chain app that requires oracle capability with a few commands and try to request data from BandChain immediately with our [Laozi Testnet 4](https://laozi-testnet4.cosmoscan.io/). For more information regarding Starport project with an oracle requesting module, you can find it [here](https://docs.starport.network/kb/band.html).
