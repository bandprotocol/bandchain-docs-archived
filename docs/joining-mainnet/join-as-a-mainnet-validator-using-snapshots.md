# How to Join as a Validator using snapshots

In this section, we'll explain the requirements and basics for running your own BandChain validator node using snapshots.

## Warning
You have to have at least 16 GB of RAM and 4 CPU Cores to use snapshots

## Step 1: Set Up Validator Node
This step provides procedures to install BandChain's executable and sync blocks with other peers.

Assuming to run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS allowing connection on port 26656 for P2P connection.

Before beginning instructions, following variables should be set to be used in further instructions. **Please make sure that these variables are set every time when using the new shell session.**

```
# Chain ID of Laozi Mainnet
export CHAIN_ID=laozi-mainnet
# Wallet name to be used as validator's account, please change this into your name (no whitespace).
export WALLET_NAME=<YOUR_WALLET_NAME>
# Name of your validator node, please change this into your name.
export MONIKER=<YOUR_MONIKER>
# URL of genesis file for Laozi Mainnet
export GENESIS_FILE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandprotocol/launch/master/laozi-mainnet/genesis.json
# Data sources/oracle scripts files
export BIN_FILES_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandprotocol/launch/master/laozi-mainnet/files.tar.gz
```

### Step 1.1: Installation
The following applications are required to build and run the BandChain node.

- make, gcc, g++ (can be obtained from build-essential package on linux)
- wget, curl for downloading files

```
# install required tools
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get upgrade -y && \
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential curl wget
```

- Install Go 1.19.1
```
# Install Go 1.19.1
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xf go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local/go

# Set Go path to $PATH variable
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:~/go/bin" >> $HOME/.profile
source ~/.profile
```
Go binary should be at /usr/local/go/bin and any executable compiled by go install command should be at ~/go/bin

### Step 1.2: Clone & Install BandChain Laozi
```
cd ~
# Clone BandChain Laozi version v2.4.1
git clone https://github.com/bandprotocol/chain
cd chain
git fetch && git checkout v2.4.1

# Install binaries to $GOPATH/bin
make install
```

### Step 1.3: Initialize the BandChain and download genesis file
```
cd $HOME

# Initialize configuration and genesis state
bandd init --chain-id $CHAIN_ID "$MONIKER"

# Replace genesis file with our genesis file
wget $GENESIS_FILE_URL -O $HOME/.band/config/genesis.json

# Download data sources / oracle scripts files, and store in $HOME/.band/files
wget -qO- $BIN_FILES_URL | tar xvz -C $HOME/.band/

# Create new account
bandd keys add $WALLET_NAME
```

### Step 1.4: Setup seeds or persistence peers of your node to the network
This can be done by editing `seeds` or `persistent_peers` property in `$HOME/.band/config/config.toml`. Please see [here](https://github.com/bandprotocol/launch/tree/master/laozi-mainnet) for the list of seeds and peers.
```
# List of seeds and persistent peers you want to add
# e.g. SEEDS="8d42bdcb6cced03e0b67fa3957e4e9c8fd89015a@34.87.86.195:26656,543e0cab9c3016a0e99775443a17bcf163038912@34.150.156.78:26656"
export SEEDS="<SEED>,<SEED>,..." 

export PERSISTENT_PEERS="<PERSISTENT_PEER>,<PERSISTENT_PEER>,..."

# Add seeds and persistent peers to config.toml
sed -E -i \
  "s/seeds = \".*\"/seeds = \"${SEEDS}\"/" \
  $HOME/.band/config/config.toml

sed -E -i \
  "s/persistent_peers = \".*\"/persistent_peers = \"${PERSISTENT_PEERS}\"/" \
  $HOME/.band/config/config.toml
```

## Step 2: Download Snapshots

Install compression tools
```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install wget liblz4-tool aria2 -y
sudo apt install -y jq
```
Download snapshots
You can choose `laozi-mainnet-pruned` size 144G or `laozi-mainnet-default` size 1.8T
```
cd ~/.band/

# change network to default/pruned/archive depending on your needs
URL=`curl -L https://quicksync.io/band.json|jq -r '.[] |select(.file=="laozi-mainnet-pruned")|.url'`
wget -O - $URL | lz4 -d | tar -xvf -
```

## Step 3: Setup Cosmovisor
This step provides procedures to setup Cosmovisor. Cosmovisor is a small process manager for Cosmos SDK application binaries that monitors the governance module via stdout for incoming chain upgrade proposals

### Step 3.1: Setup environment variables
Add required environment variables for Cosmovisor into your profile

```
cd ~
echo "export DAEMON_NAME=bandd" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.band" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

### Step 3.2: Setup Cosmovisor
Install Cosmovisor and provide bandd binary to Cosmovisor

```
# Install Cosmovisor
go install github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.0.0

# Setup folder and provide bandd binary for Cosmovisor Genesis
mkdir -p $HOME/.band/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir -p $HOME/.band/cosmovisor/upgrades
cp $HOME/go/bin/bandd $HOME/.band/cosmovisor/genesis/bin

# Setup folder and provide bandd binary for Cosmovisor Upgrades
mkdir -p $HOME/.band/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2_4/bin
cp $HOME/go/bin/bandd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2_4/bin
```

### Step 3.3: Create BandChain service
We do recommend to run bandchain node as a daemon, which can be setup using `systemctl`. Run the following command to create a new daemon for `cosmovisor` that runs bandd (This script work on non-root user).

```
# Write bandd service file to /etc/systemd/system/bandd.service
export USERNAME=$(whoami)
sudo -E bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/bandd.service
[Unit]
Description=BandChain Node Daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=bandd"
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=${HOME}/.band"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
User=$USERNAME
ExecStart=${HOME}/go/bin/cosmovisor start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

## Step 4: Setup Yoda
Since a subset of validators who are selected for a data request must send the data they received as a transaction of [MsgReportData](https://docs.bandchain.org/whitepaper/protocol-messages.html#msgreportdatas) to BandChain.

Yoda is a program used by BandChain's validator nodes to help automatically query data from data providers by executing data source script, then submitting the result to fulfill the request. Read more on the [Yoda section](https://docs.bandchain.org/joining-mainnet/yoda.html).

### Step 4.1: Installation
Before setting up Yoda, Lambda function executor need to be setup to execute data sources. If this step has not been done yet, please follow the instructions on following pages (select either one of these methods):

- [AWS Lambda Function](https://github.com/bandprotocol/data-source-runtime/wiki/Setup-Yoda-Executor-Using-AWS-Lambda)
- [Google Cloud Function](https://github.com/bandprotocol/data-source-runtime/wiki/Setup-Yoda-Executor-Using-Google-Cloud-Function)

To check Yoda version, use the following command.
```
yoda version
# v2.4.1
```

### Step 4.2: Set the Yoda configurations
Use the command below to config your Yoda, replacing $VARIABLES with their actual values.

```
rm -rf ~/.yoda # clear old config if exist
yoda config chain-id $CHAIN_ID
yoda config node http://localhost:26657
yoda config broadcast-timeout "5m"
yoda config rpc-poll-interval "1s"
yoda config max-try 5
yoda config validator $(bandd keys show $WALLET_NAME -a --bech val)
```

Then, add multiple reporter accounts to allow Yoda to submit transactions concurrently.

```
yoda keys add REPORTER_1
yoda keys add REPORTER_2
yoda keys add REPORTER_3
yoda keys add REPORTER_4
yoda keys add REPORTER_5
```

Lastly, configure the Lambda Executor endpoint to helps running data source scripts and return results to Yoda. More details about the executor can be found in [this section](https://docs.bandchain.org/joining-mainnet/remote-data-source-executor.html).

```
export EXECUTOR_URL=<YOUR_EXECUTOR_URL>
yoda config executor "rest:${EXECUTOR_URL}?timeout=10s"
```

### Step 4.3: Start Yoda
To start Yoda, it's also recommend to use systemctl.

```
# Write yoda service to /etc/systemd/system/yoda.service
export USERNAME=$(whoami)
sudo -E bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/yoda.service
[Unit]
Description=Yoda Daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USERNAME
ExecStart=/home/$USERNAME/go/bin/yoda run
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```
The first time running the Yoda, you will need to register both bandd and yoda services by running the following commands.

```
# Register bandd daemon to systemctl
sudo systemctl enable bandd
# Register yoda to systemctl
sudo systemctl enable yoda
```

Then start bandd and yoda services

```
# Start bandd daemon
sudo systemctl start bandd
# Start yoda daemon
sudo systemctl start yoda
```

Once `bandd` service has been started, logs can be queried by running `journalctl -u bandd.service -f` command. You will see your node beginning to sync.

After `yoda` service has been started, logs can be queried by running `journalctl -u yoda.service -f` command. Log should be similar to the following log example below. Once verified, you can stop tailing the log by typing `Control-C`.

```
... systemd[...]: Started Yoda Daemon.
... yoda[...]: I[...] ‚≠ê  Creating HTTP client with node URI: tcp://localhost:26657
... yoda[...]: I[...] üöÄ  Starting WebSocket subscriber
... yoda[...]: I[...] üëÇ  Subscribing to events with query: tm.event = 'Tx'...
```

### Step 4.4: Wait for the latest blocks to be synced
**This is an important step**. We should wait for newly started BandChain node to sync their blocks until the latest block is reached. The latest block can be checked on [CosmoScan](https://www.cosmoscan.io/blocks).

## Step 5: Become a Validator
This guide will show you how to register the running node as a validator. So that the program can fulfill the data on BandChain.

### Step 5.1: Fund the Validator Account
```
bandd keys show $WALLET_NAME
```
Then fund tokens into this account ready for staking.

### Step 5.2: Stake Tokens with the Validator Account
```
bandd tx staking create-validator \
    --amount 3000000uband \
    --commission-max-change-rate 0.01 \
    --commission-max-rate 0.2 \
    --commission-rate 0.1 \
    --from $WALLET_NAME \
    --min-self-delegation 1 \
    --moniker "$MONIKER" \
    --pubkey $(bandd tendermint show-validator) \
    --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```
Registered validators can be found on [CosmoScan](h[ttps://](https://www.cosmoscan.io/validators)).

### Step 5.3: Register Reporters and Become Oracle Provider
Yoda contains multiple reporters. You will need to register the reporters in order to help the validator submit transactions of reporting data.

Firstly, reporter accounts must be create on BandChain by supplying some small amount of BAND tokens.

```
# Send 1uband from a wallet to each reporter.
bandd tx multi-send 1uband $(yoda keys list -a) \
  --from $WALLET_NAME \
  --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```
Secondly, register reporters to the validator, so that oracle requests for validator can be assigned to the reporters.

```
bandd tx oracle add-reporters $(yoda keys list -a) \
  --from $WALLET_NAME \
  --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```
Finally, activate the validator to become an oracle provider

```
bandd tx oracle activate \
  --from $WALLET_NAME \
  --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```
If all procedures are successful, then oracle provider status for the validator should be active.

```
bandd query oracle validator $(bandd keys show -a $WALLET_NAME --bech val)

# {
#   "is_active": true,
#   "since": ...
# }
```
And now you have become a validator on BandChain Laozi mainnet.

Happy staking üìà, and may the HODL be with you.
